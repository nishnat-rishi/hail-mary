  (done? spring.lua) Can encapsulae the various physicsy things into a
  smol_physics.lua module with some cute ways to provide springyness
  and so on to components.

  (DONE) Scroll stuff can be tested as well

  components need their own module! lots of tree_draw, attach_*, and
  so on and so forth lying around here and there!
